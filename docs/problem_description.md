## Problem Description
### Business Context
The online gaming industry thrives on high player engagement, which directly correlates with increased revenue through in-game purchases, subscription fees, and sustained player base growth. Player engagement is a critical metric that impacts user retention, word-of-mouth promotion, and overall game popularity. Analyzing and predicting player engagement can help gaming companies develop strategies to enhance player experience, retain more players, and optimize revenue streams.

### Problem Statement
The **objective is to analyze the provided player data to predict the engagement level of the players**  ('High', 'Medium', 'Low'). Given features about the player and his gaming sessions' statistics, we'll try to forecast the engagement level of that player, the likelihood of continuing playing or leaving the platform. Using these predictions, the goal is to identify actionable insights and strategies to improve player engagement, thereby enhancing player retention and increasing revenue from in-game purchases and other monetization strategies.

- In our scenario, data about players and their playing behavior are collected every day.
- From the collected data, we can prepare and train an ML model to predict a player's engagement level.  
- Then, each day in the evening, we run a batch inference process to obtain a prediction of each player's engagement level and this data is stored in a shared, presistent cloud storage. 
- At the end of the week, we can compile the actual truth or target value based on the level of engagement the player has shown during the week. This means that we can have new training data.
- Every weekend, we can retrain our model and record a new version, a candidate model.
- Every Monday, we select the best model, compare the candidate model with the production model, establish the new best model and move it to production.
- Every night we run performance tests to check for problems related to data or model drift. If any of the relevant tests fail, we can force a retraining step.
- Some performance monitoring reports are also run every day. These are saved, and the ML team will have access to a dashboard and reports to keep up to date on model performance.

### Approach Using Machine Learning
#### Data Understanding and Preprocessing
* Data Collection: Gather the dataset with fields about the gamers and their gaming behavior on the platform.
* Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct any inconsistencies in the data.
* Feature Engineering: Create or remove  features if necessary.
* Encode categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Location, GameGenre, EngagementLevel) using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
* Data Splitting: Divide the data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.

#### Model Selection and Training
* Algorithm Choice: Consider various machine learning algorithms such as:
	- Logistic Regression: For baseline performance and interpretability.
	- Random Forest: For handling complex interactions and providing feature importance.
	- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): For high accuracy and robustness.
	- Neural Networks: If the data is sufficiently large and complex.

* Model Training: Train multiple models and perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like cross-validation to optimize model performance.
* Feature Importance Analysis: Identify which features are most influential in predicting player engagement.

**Important**: We will not focus in the machine learning model and how to get the better approach. Therefore, **we will simplify tasks such as feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning**. This project is about MLOps, and we will try to provide a solution to orchestrate the several pipelines this kind of problem requires. Consecuently, **we will not create any new feature**, **we have already chosen the model Gradient Booster** and we will not perform a hyperparameter tuning job, **we have selected some standard parameters**.

#### Model Evaluation
* Metrics:
	- Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
	- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: For evaluating the balance between precision and recall, especially for the 'High' engagement category.
	- Confusion Matrix: To understand the types of errors the model is making.

#### Deployment and Monitoring
* Model Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model into the production environment.
* Continuous Monitoring: Track model performance over time to ensure it remains accurate and relevant, retraining as necessary.

### Business Objective and Optimization

Strategies to Improve Player Engagement
* In-Game Purchases: Recommend items or upgrades that align with the player's gaming behavior and preferences.
* Engagement Level-Based Campaigns: Create specific campaigns for 'Medium' and 'Low' engagement players to re-engage them with tailored offers, rewards, and incentives.
* Retention Programs: Design loyalty programs for 'High' engagement players to maintain their interest and reward their loyalty.
* In-Game Events and Achievements: Organize special in-game events and introduce new achievements to keep the game fresh and engaging.

### Return on Investment (ROI)
* Increased Revenue: By enhancing player engagement, the company can boost in-game purchases and subscription renewals.
* Reduced Churn Rate: Improved engagement leads to higher retention, reducing the cost associated with acquiring new players.
* Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Higher engagement generally increases the lifetime value of players, leading to long-term profitability.
